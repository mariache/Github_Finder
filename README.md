Github Finder is a simple app to search for github users

## Getting Started
[Demo](https://github-users-finder.netlify.com/) can be found [here](https://github-users-finder.netlify.com/)</br>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.</br>


### Prerequisites

 Register a new [GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) to get started developing on the GitHub API and generate access token. You can also read more about building in developer [documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/about-apps/).

### Installing

After you generated the token you can clone the repo and use your token to get full access to it's functionality

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
