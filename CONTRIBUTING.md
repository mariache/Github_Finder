# TLTR: Create a Pull Request in 5 steps: 
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your new repository to your system.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Commit changes and push the new branch.
5. Open and submit a PR.

### Next Steps

#### If your PR is accepted

Once your PR is accepted, you may delete the branch you created to submit it. This keeps your working fork clean.

You can do this with a press of a button on the GitHub PR interface. You can delete the local copy of the branch with: `git branch -D branch/to-delete-name`

#### If your PR comes back

Don't despair! You are probably being asked to make a formatting change. If you have a local copy of the repo, you can make the requested changes, commit them and push them to your fork.
